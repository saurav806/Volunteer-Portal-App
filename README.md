# Volunteer-Portal-App

This document lays out a project plan for the “NITC Volunteer Portal”. The plan will include, but is not limited to, product functionality, product design and implementation, scope of the project from the perspective of team members, and the identified requirements. This is fully functional software which is used to hire volunteers from NITC where the admin can post the requirements according to the event and the students can apply to volunteer for the event. The application focuses on minimalism of manual work and is fully controlled over the phased process.
