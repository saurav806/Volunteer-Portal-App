# Volunteer-Portal-App
<h2>2.1 Product Overview</h2>
- In the NITC campus so many activities are organised very frequently and it all requires a lot of effort from so many volunteers. But there is no reliable system in place to manage all the volunteers.
- This product is called NITC Volunteer Portal and it’s a new, self-contained product created to solve a problem of our NITC campus.
- If the organiser needs few volunteers, for now they need to approach all of the students for help whether someone is interested in the opportunity or not. So it is a problem to reach the right people to organise the event.
- Similarly, the interested students also face the problem of finding the right opportunities to volunteer. Sometimes they can miss the email that they got in their inbox.
- To solve the problem, we’ve come up with NITC Volunteer Portal which is an Android application that can be used by both the volunteers and the admin. It will make it very easy for the organiser to reach the interested volunteers and hence they can now focus on more important tasks.
- Similarly with the portal, students will also get all of the information regarding the upcoming events at a common place that will help them apply to the activities in which they are interested.
