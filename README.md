# Volunteer-Portal-App
<h2>1.1 Introduction</h2>
This document lays out a project plan for the “NITC Volunteer Portal”. The plan will include, but is not limited to, product functionality, product design and implementation, scope of the project from the perspective of team members, and the identified requirements. This is fully functional software which is used to hire volunteers from NITC where the admin can post the requirements according to the event and the students can apply to volunteer for the event. The application focuses on minimalism of manual work and is fully controlled over the phased process.

<h2>1.2 Product Scope</h2>
NITC Volunteer Portal provides an easily accessible space for volunteers to easily apply for their respective interested events by providing some personal details and their field of interest. It also provides admin to approve or reject the volunteer applications according to their interest and past experience of their respective field. The primary goal of this application is to create a smooth hiring process between the volunteers and event organisers in NITC. This will help in saving their time and effort as the students can apply through this application and similarly the admin/organiser can save their time by reviewing the application/request quickly by reviewing volunteer’s skills, experience and interest.

<h2>2.1 Product Overview</h2>
- In the NITC campus so many activities are organised very frequently and it all requires a lot of effort from so many volunteers. But there is no reliable system in place to manage all the volunteers.
- This product is called NITC Volunteer Portal and it’s a new, self-contained product created to solve a problem of our NITC campus.
- If the organiser needs few volunteers, for now they need to approach all of the students for help whether someone is interested in the opportunity or not. So it is a problem to reach the right people to organise the event.
- Similarly, the interested students also face the problem of finding the right opportunities to volunteer. Sometimes they can miss the email that they got in their inbox.
- To solve the problem, we’ve come up with NITC Volunteer Portal which is an Android application that can be used by both the volunteers and the admin. It will make it very easy for the organiser to reach the interested volunteers and hence they can now focus on more important tasks.
- Similarly with the portal, students will also get all of the information regarding the upcoming events at a common place that will help them apply to the activities in which they are interested.
